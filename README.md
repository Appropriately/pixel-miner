## Clicker game built in AngularJS

A "clicker game" I started working on as an excuse to experiment with AngularJS but decided to continue working on it.

## Current version (v0.2)

Features

* Autosaving feature: saves number of buildings, purchased upgrades and statistics.
* Statistics tab: view statistics from current playthrough. Currently this feature is fairly basic, as there is only one tracked statistic.
* Debug mode: debug building/upgrade options moved to settings.

Fixes

* Improved some CSS so buildings scale better when the text wraps.
