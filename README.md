## Clicker game built in AngularJS

A "clicker game" I started working on as an excuse to experiment with AngularJS but decided to continue working on it.

## Current version (v0.3)

Features

* Number postfix: Added number postfixes so as the number increases it doesn't get insanely big and look awkward inside its container.
* Save file reset: Added an option in the settings to reset the save file.
* Animations: Initial animations. They are a little basic and there is plenty of room for improvement.
* Message system: Popup message system for giving information to the user.
